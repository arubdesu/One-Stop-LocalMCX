These are two payload-free packages which (when configured) enable distributing LocalMCX management at the computergroup level.  Currently these are both tailored to a modular, package-based image building system like InstaDMG, but the principles could be used to roll out LocalMCX management for an environment that has already deployed the workstations they would like to manage.

The createUser2010 package (optionally) sets up a second dslocal node/directory for MCX settings, and adds a user in that node so Workgroup Manager can be used to update the management settings.  Also optional is the changes required to turn on SSH and ARD for the created user (and that user only).

The LocalMCX-starter package puts a single piece of management in place and uses (an admittedly rough at the moment) LaunchD-called script to bootstrap applying that management to whichever workstation the image is applied to.

Described at length on Greg Neagle's blog (most recently http://managingosx.wordpress.com/2010/03/12/yet-again-with-the-local-mcx/ ), these packages originate from applying techniques documented there (which evolved from conversations on AFP548.com and the MacEnterprise list, with contributions by Karl Kuehn and Nigel Kersten) and Peter Akins (with the University of Cincinnati staff).  <Sir Issac Newton quote goes here>
